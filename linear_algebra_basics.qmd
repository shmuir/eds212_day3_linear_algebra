## Vectors in R

```{r}
marmots <- c("blue", "green", 4, "yellow", TRUE)
#all become characters bc different types can't exist in vectors
```

```{r}
pika <- c(12.4, 6.8, 2.9, 8.9, 5)
#all are numeric so it's a numeric vector
```

```{r}
bear <- c(20L, 3L, 5L, 18L)
#adding an L after each number makes them integers
```


### Vector Addition and Subtraction

```{r}
ringtail <- c(4.3, 8.9, 2.6, 7.1)
fox <- c(9.0, 12.5, 5.4, 10.9)

ringtail_fox <- ringtail + fox
ringtail_fox

ringtail_minus_fox <- ringtail - fox
ringtail_minus_fox
```

### Scalar Multiplier 

```{r}
100 * ringtail
```

### Dot Product

```{r}
ringtail %*% fox
```
