## Vectors in R

```{r}
marmots <- c("blue", "green", 4, "yellow", TRUE)
#all become characters bc different types can't exist in vectors
```

```{r}
pika <- c(12.4, 6.8, 2.9, 8.9, 5)
#all are numeric so it's a numeric vector
```

```{r}
bear <- c(20L, 3L, 5L, 18L)
#adding an L after each number makes them integers
```
